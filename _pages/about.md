I am a PhD researcher at the **Institute for Geosciences, Kiel University** where I develop physics‑informed neural networks (PINNs) and other scientific machine‑learning techniques for elastic wave modelling and *full‑waveform inversion* problems. My work bridges numerical simulations with field‑scale seismic monitoring for structural‑health and subsurface applications.

### Research interests
* Scientific Machine Learning & Operator Learning  
* Physics‑Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)  
* Wave propagation & inverse problems  
* Remote sensing & IoT for geophysical monitoring  

### Short bio
Originally trained in Mathematics at **Aligarh Muslim University**, I completed an MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the *University of Genoa* before moving to Germany for doctoral work. Alongside academia I build remote monitoring systems with **Kumva IoT** and contribute to open‑source projects on GitHub.

Feel free to reach out via e‑mail or on Twitter; I enjoy collaborations at the intersection of geophysics, ML and edge sensing.
